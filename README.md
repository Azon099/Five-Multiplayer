# Compiling

In order to compile the mod, it is recommended to use *Visual Studio 2013* or [*Visual Studio CE (Community Edition) 2013*](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx) if possible. Otherwise the mod may not work / may crash during the loading screen. *We've tried compiling the project with Visual Studio CE 2015 but to no avail, it crashed.*
As of now, the mod may only be compiled in *debug mode x64*.

# Binaries

After compiling the mod, 64 bit binaries can be found in Five-Multiplayer\FiveMP\x64 and 32 bit binaries in Five-Multiplayer\FiveMP\Debug.
Double clicking *FiveMP_Launcher.exe* should start the mod and start a new game. Binaries don't need to be in any specific location but they should all be within the same directory for the mod to work. Except for the server files.
